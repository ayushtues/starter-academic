Hi! I am a Data Scientist working in [Bing Travel](https://www.bing.com/travel), helping make their visual content make people go WoW :heart:. I am currently interested in using Deep learning to make awesome products. 

During my undergrad I had the pleasure of working in various academic research labs and startups on topics ranging from Computer Vision, to NLP, finance, reinforcement learning. I was also involved in leading various undergrad research groups, focusing on Deep Learning, Core CS, Quantum Computing and Blockchain. 

Professional stuff aside, I am a die-hard anime fan, an avid reader, wannabe Musician/Writer/Youtuber? lol (checkout my YT channel and Medium!) and a lifelong learner who's always up for a good conversation.
